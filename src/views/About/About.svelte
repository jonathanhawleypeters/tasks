<div id="about" class="section">
  <p>Tasks is a proof-of-concept. It is built so that data stays on the user's device(s) and in their control.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>works offline</li>
    <li>text file backups</li>
    <li>syncing between two devices</li>
    <li>no login or sign up</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Limitations</h2>
    
  <ol>
    <li>no login means no logging out or password protecting tasks</li>
    <li>to sync tasks over a network, both devices must be online at the same time, because tasks aren't saved anywhere else.</li>
    <li>because Tasks is a proof-of-concept, it is brutally minimalist which means no scheduling, catergorization, labelling, re-ordering, snoozing, sharing or grouping of tasks. Partly, this is because such features would make implementing a CRDT more complicated</li>
    <li>presently, deleting data requires either 1) deleting all data via site settings in the browser or 2) opening developer tools and fiddling with indexedDB for more fine-grained control</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  
  <p>The achitecture is distributedâ€“each instance of Tasks works in isolation. To resolve changes made in separate instances, Tasks implements a <a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDT</a> (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type).</p>
  
  <h2>Technologies</h2>

  <p>The application uses the following technologies:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps">PWAs</a>: a group of technologies that can help websites work offline</li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/indexedDB">indexedDB</a>: a database widely supported in web browsers</li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebRTC">WebRTC</a>: a P2P technology that allows direct connections between two devices</li>
    <li><a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>: a framework for developing web applications with Svelte</li>
  </ol>
